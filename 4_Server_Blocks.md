let's dive deeper into configuring `server blocks (virtual hosts)` in Nginx. Server blocks allow you to host multiple websites or applications on a single Nginx server, each with its own configuration. Here's a more detailed look at setting up and managing server blocks:

**1. Create Server Blocks:**

To create a server block, follow these steps:

- **Create a Configuration File**: Typically, each server block is defined in its own configuration file. You can create these files in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory. For example, you might create a file named `example.com` for your `example.com` website.

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
  ```

- **Configure the Server Block**: Inside the configuration file, define the server block, specifying the domain name, root directory, and other settings:

  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name example.com www.example.com;
      root /var/www/example.com;
  
      location / {
          index index.html;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Enable the Server Block**: To activate the server block, create a symbolic link to it in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory. This allows Nginx to read and use the configuration:

  ```bash
  sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
  ```

**2. Disabling or Deleting Server Blocks:**

If you need to disable or delete a server block:

- **Disabling**: To temporarily disable a server block without deleting its configuration, remove the symbolic link from the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory:

  ```bash
  sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com
  ```

  Then, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```

- **Deleting**: To permanently delete a server block's configuration, you can remove the configuration file from the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory:

  ```bash
  sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
  ```

  After deleting the configuration file, don't forget to remove the symbolic link from the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory as well. Then, reload Nginx.

**3. Default Server Block:**

Nginx will always use a default server block to handle requests for domains that do not match any configured server block. Typically, this default server block is used to return a "404 Not Found" or a default page.

**4. Server Block Prioritization:**

Nginx processes server blocks in the order they appear in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory. The first server block that matches the requested domain is used. Make sure to organize your server block configuration files in a way that prioritizes specific configurations over generic ones.

**5. Wildcard Server Names:**

You can use wildcard characters in the `server_name` directive to match subdomains or multiple domains. For example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name *.example.com;
    root /var/www/subdomains;
}
```

This server block will handle requests for any subdomain of `example.com`.

**6. HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Configuration:**

For secure connections using HTTPS, you can create a separate server block with SSL/TLS settings, and configure SSL certificates. This typically involves using the `listen 443` directive and specifying SSL certificate files.

**7. Testing Configuration and Reloading Nginx:**

After creating or modifying server blocks, always test your Nginx configuration for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

These are the essential steps and considerations for configuring server blocks in Nginx. Server blocks allow you to host multiple websites or applications on a single server while keeping their configurations separate and organized.
